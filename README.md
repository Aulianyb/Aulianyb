I'm an Information Systems and Technology student at Bandung Institute of Technology. I'm interested in full-stack web development, software engineering and UI/UX. I'm currently learning about data warehousing and project management. Most of my repositories here are my group and individual projects for university, but i do enjoy working on my personal projects ( •̀ ω •́ )✧
